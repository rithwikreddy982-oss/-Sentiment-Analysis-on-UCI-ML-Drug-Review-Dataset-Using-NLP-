# -Sentiment-Analysis-on-UCI-ML-Drug-Review-Dataset-Using-NLP-
"Performed Sentiment Analysis on the UCI ML Drug Review Dataset using NLP techniques to classify patient reviews as positive or negative. Included text preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation to understand drug effectiveness based on user feedback."
This project focuses on analyzing patient drug reviews from the UCI ML Drug Review Dataset to determine their sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral—using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset contains thousands of user-generated reviews along with corresponding drug names, conditions, and ratings, making it a rich source for sentiment classification.

The project begins with data cleaning, handling missing values, and preprocessing text using standard NLP steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and punctuation filtering. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand review patterns, word frequency, rating distribution, and sentiment tendencies across different drugs and conditions.

For modeling, the reviews are transformed into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF vectorization. Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM are trained and compared for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final model chosen provides robust sentiment classification based on textual patterns and user ratings.

The results include key insights into how patients perceive various drugs, highlighting common themes in positive and negative reviews. Word clouds, confusion matrices, and performance metrics are used to visually interpret the findings. The project demonstrates how NLP can extract meaningful sentiment trends from textual healthcare data, supporting better understanding of drug effectiveness and user satisfaction.

This analysis can assist pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, and researchers in identifying patient concerns, evaluating drug performance, and improving communication strategies. Overall, the project showcases proficiency in Python, NLP preprocessing, machine learning workflow, and result interpretation.
